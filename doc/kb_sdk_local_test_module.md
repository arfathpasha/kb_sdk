### 5. Locally Test Module and Method(s)


#### <A NAME="dockerfile"></A>5A. Edit Dockerfile

The base KBase Docker image contains a KBase Ubuntu image, but not much else.  You will need to add whatever dependencies, including the installation of whatever tool you are wrapping, to the Dockerfile that is executed to build a custom Docker image that can run your Module.

For example:

```
RUN \
  git clone https://github.com/voutcn/megahit.git && \
  cd megahit && \
  git checkout tags/v1.0.3 && \
  make
```

Note: you do not have to add any lines to the Dockerfile for installing your SDK Module code, as this will happen automatically.  The contents of your SDK Module git repo will be added at /kb/module.

It is also important to note that layers in the Docker image are generated by each command in the Dockerfile.  For a streamline Docker image which will deploy on a worker node more quickly and make cycles of Docker image builds faster, it is best to remove any large, extraneous files, such as a tarball from which you installed a tool.

So you want commands in your Dockerfile like this:

```
RUN \
  wget blah.com/tarball.tgz && \
  tar xzf tarball.tgz && \
  cd tarball && \
  make && \
  cd .. && \
  rm -rf tarball.tgz
```

instead of this (**Bad**):

```
RUN wget blah.com/tarball.tgz
RUN tar xzf tarball.tgz
RUN cd tarball
RUN make
RUN cd ..
RUN rm -rf tarball.tgz
```

because the latter does not remove the previous bloating layers, despite the "rm" command.

Final Note: Docker will rebuild everything from the first detected change in a dockerfile but pull everything upstream of that from cache. This means that if you are pulling in external data using RUN and a command like `git clone` or `wget` changes in those sources will not automatically be reflected in a rebuilt docker image unless the docker file changes at or before that import.

#### <A NAME="get-token"></A>5B. Get a developer token

If you have already been approved as a KBase developer, a token may be generated from your [kbase account profile](https://narrative.kbase.us/#auth2/account) under the Developer Tokens tab.

#### <A NAME="build-tests"></A>5C. Build tests of your methods

Edit the local test config file (`test_local/test.cfg`) with a developer token (note that this directory is in .gitignore so will not be copied to github.  You're safe!):

    test_token = TEST_TOKEN

*In the Docker shell*, run tests:

    cd test_local
    kb-sdk test

This will build your Docker container, run the method implementation running in the Docker container that fetches example ContigSet data from the KBase CI database and generates output.  

Inspect the Docker container, such as seeing whether your wrapped tool was installed properly, by dropping into a bash console and poke around.  From the `test_local` directory:
    
    ./run_bash.sh

Unfortunately, you will have to rebuild the Docker image each time you change your module code (e.g. KIDL \<MyModule\>.spec, \<MyModule\>Impl.py, and your testing code) but this happens automatically for you when you run *kb-sdk test*, so it just slows you down rather than add any extra effort.  However, if you change the KIDL \<MyModule\>.spec file, you will have to rerun *make* to propagate those changes to the \<MyModule\>Client and \<MyModule\>Impl code (and likely will have some tweaks to apply to the Impl code to match the spec changes).  Happy debugging!

**(don't forget to *git commit* and *git push* your edits to your github repo)**
